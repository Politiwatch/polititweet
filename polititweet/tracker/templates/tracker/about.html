        <p>PolitiTweet protects the public record by maintaining a persistent archive of public figures' Tweets.</p>
        <p>PolitiTweet monitors public (and primarily political) figures online, creating a stable and persistent
            database that can be referred to for news articles, citations, and other reference. A primary advantage of
            PolitiTweet is that its database remains intact when, for example, a tweet is
            deleted. That's why PolitiTweet has deleted Tweets&mdash;it's nothing magical.</p>

        <p>PolitiTweet only monitors <i>public figures</i>&mdash;and we only monitor those public figures' <i>public
                accounts</i>. In essence, we track those whose Twitter accounts' messaging could have a significant
            impact to many people. PolitiTweet is not meant to strip individuals of their privacy; instead, it exists
            simply to secure the public record on Twitter.</p>
        <p>If your Twitter account is being archived by PolitiTweet and you would like it to be removed, you may email
            <a href="mailto:secure@politiwatch.org">secure@politiwatch.org</a>. You will be required to verify that the
            Twitter account you would like to remove is, in fact, yours.</p>
